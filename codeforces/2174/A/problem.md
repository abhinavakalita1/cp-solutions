You got lucky to know the answer to all important questions in the world. This time, the answer is the string s
, consisting of lowercase English letters only. You want to hide this string.

You have another string t
 also consisting of lowercase English letters only. You need to shuffle the letters in t
 so that the string s
 appears at least once in t
 as a subsequence∗
. Among all possible reorderings of t
 containing s
 as a subsequence, find the lexicographically smallest†
 one.

∗
A sequence a
 is a subsequence of a sequence b
 if a
 can be obtained from b
 by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.

†
A string a
 is lexicographically smaller than string b
 if and only if one of the following holds:

a
 is a prefix of b
, but a≠b
; or
in the first position where a
 and b
 differ, the string a
 has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases T
 (1≤T≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains the string s
 (1≤|s|≤105
), where |s|
 is the length of the string s
.

The second line of each test case contains the string t
 (|s|≤|t|≤105
).

Both strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

The sum of |t|
 over all test cases does not exceed 105
.

Output
For each test case, print a single string: the lexicographically smallest reordering of letters in the string t
 that contains s
 as a subsequence. If no such string exists, print "Impossible" instead.

Example

3
dcbe
bedbaecfc
babadab
abacabadabacaba
babaisyou
flagiswin
OutputCopy
abcdcbeef
aaaaabababccdab
Impossible
Note
In the first test case, abcdcbeef
 contains dcbe
.

In the second test case, aaaaabababccdab
 also contains babadab
.

It can be proven that these are the lexicographically smallest strings satisfying the given condition.

In the third test case, no rearrangement of letters in t
 contains s
.
